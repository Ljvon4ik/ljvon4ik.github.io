				<h2>3xBall Bowling</h2>
				    <div class = "description-games">
					<p>The prototype was developed as part of Unity courses. The task was to create a game prototype with a score counter.
					In this project, I got a closer look at creating 3D games.
					The goal of the game is to achieve the highest score by getting three consecutive strikes. 
					The red marker determines the direction of the ball's movement. 
					The slider at the bottom of the screen controls the throwing force. 
					After three throws, you can see your score and personal best.
					The game project is available on <a href = "https://github.com/Ljvon4ik/Bowling_in_the_desert">GitHub.<a></p>

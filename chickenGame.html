				<h2>Battle for the Chicken</h2>
				    <div class = "description-games">
					<p>This is my first game, and on this project, I learned the basic skills of working not only with Unity but also with Visual Studio and C#..</p>
					<p>I personally created all the code, sprites, and animations..</p>
					<p>Basic mechanics include left/right movement, jumping, melee combat in the form of tail strikes, and shooting, in my case, throwing apples. 
					Settings include sound settings for buttons, effects, music, or all at once. 
					Enhancements include player speed increase, extra lives, higher jump power, double jump, and melee combat. 
					Enemies and obstacles include fire, spikes, moles, various types of spiders, birds, and rats. 
					UI elements consist of control buttons, life count, seeds (an additional game element, with the goal to find 3 in one level), 
					crystals (used for character upgrades), the count of apples and stars, and a pause button. In the game, there are boxes, bags, 
					and chests that contain various goodies.</p>
